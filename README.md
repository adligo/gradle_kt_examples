# gradle_kt_examples

This project contains a large number of example Gradle Kotlin Builds, from the simplest to the most complex.  This project can be used as a tutorial to teach others Kotlin, Gradle, Java and the various complexities that occur when putting them together in various ways. 

The basic folder contains the most basic test project, which you should be able to at least run;
- ``` cd basic/first ```
- ``` gradle build ```

The all.sh script runs all of the sub Gradle builds (and is mostly used as a sanity check / test to make sure that they all work :)

Eacn 2nd level folder is the root of a Gradle Build (unlike the convention which is to have a Gradle Build at the root of a Git Project).  This allows me to keep a large number of Gradle Kotlin Examples together.
